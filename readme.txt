Be creative with colors and fonts in TwentyThirteen. Styles changes everything.

== Description ==

This plugin adds suport for the TwentyThirteen theme to the [Styles plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/styles).

WordPress has lots of beautiful themes, but personalizing a design can be difficult and time-intensive. Styles changes that. Styles gives you creative control in one consistent interface – the WordPress theme customizer. Styles lets you make your site your own. :)

**Features of the plugin include:**

* Instant previews
* Text size
* Google Fonts
* Text colors
* Border colors
* Background colors
* Hundreds of options
* Consistent interface and names in every theme
* Built on WordPress customizer, so Styles grows as WordPress grows

Styles and options for all built-in WordPress themes are free. More themes are available at [StylesPlugin.com](http://stylesplugin.com).

**Free Themes include:**

* [TwentyTen](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/styles-twentyten)
* [TwentyEleven](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/styles-twentyeleven)
* [TwentyTwelve](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/styles-twentytwelve)
* [TwentyThirteen](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/styles-twentythirteen)

== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= I activated this plugin, but nothing happened! =

This is an add-on plugin for Styles that adds support for this theme. Make sure you have both this plugin and the Styles plugin installed, then check out all your new options under <code>WordPress Admin > Appearance > Customize</code>.

= Why is this plugin free? =

We believe life is better when we work together. :) Support for WordPress default themes, like TwentyTwelve and TwentyThirteen, will always be free. Continued development in Styles will be supported by:

* Plugins for additional themes
* Plugins for add-on features
* Premium support and updates
* Documentation for using Styles in your own themes

= Does Styles support my theme? =

Maybe! We have additional themes available available at [StylesPlugin.com](http://stylesplugin.com). If you don't find your theme there, we also have documentation on how to create options using styles available for developers. Adding one option takes only one line of code.

= Will this plugin slow down my site? =

No! Styles is very careful about only loading what is needed to get its job done. Once you're done editing, stylesheets are cached and loaded for your sites users as quickly as possible.
